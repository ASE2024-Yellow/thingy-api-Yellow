[![Codacy Badge](https://app.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/f787516c9d074c3bb14e8155cdd1d683)](https://app.codacy.com?utm_source=gh&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=&utm_campaign=Badge_grade)
## Introduction
Our project is Bike Accident Detection. 

### Introduction to the problem

Many individuals (elderly, cyclists, scooter users) are vulnerable to falls, which can lead to serious injuries.

### Key Goal

Detect falls in real-time and initiate emergency protocols to help users who are incapacitated.

### Thingy:91 

attached to a mobility device (bike, wheelchair, etc.).Detects falls and emits sound alarms. Automatically contacts emergency services if the user doesnâ€™t respond within 30 seconds, using GPS for location tracking.

### Core Features

- Detection: Trigger alarms when an abrupt fall is detected.
- Emergency Alerts: Automatic emergency calls after 30 seconds with GPS location.
- Mobility Mode Customization: Switch between bike, wheelchair, scooter, etc., to optimize data processing.
- Surrounding ambient: detects the temperature, light, air humidity, etc. to display on the app

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/thingy-api-Yellow.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd thingy-api-Yellow
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following environment variables:

```
MONGODB_URI='your-mongodb-uri'
INFLUXDB_URI='your-influxdb-uri'
INFLUXDB_TOKEN='your-influxdb-token'
MQTT_USR='your-mqtt-username'
MQTT_PWD='your-mqtt-password'
MQTT_SERVER='your-mqtt-server-url'
MQTT_PORT='your-mqtt-port'
JWT_SECRET='your-jwt-secret'
```

Replace the placeholders with your actual configuration values.

## Usage

Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

The API will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Deployment
For production deployment, use Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up
```

## API Documentation

Refer to the `ASE2024-Yellow-Sprint1-API.yml` and `ASE2024-Yellow-Sprint2-API.yml` files for detailed API endpoint information.
